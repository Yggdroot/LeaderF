Changelog
---------

Please see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Yggdroot/LeaderF/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a release history.

Screenshots
-----------

![NameOnly Mode][1]

![FullPath Mode][2]

Requirements
------------

 - vim7.3 or higher. Only support vim7.4.330 or higher after [v1.01](https://github.com/Yggdroot/LeaderF/releases/tag/v1.01).
 - vim compiled with Python support, you can check by using `echo has('python')` or `echo has('python3')` to see if the result is `1`; Make sure that your python2 version is Python **2.7** or higher and python3 version is Python **3.1** or higher.

Installation
------------

To install this plugin just put the plugin files in your `~/.vim` (Linux) or `~/vimfiles` (Windows).<br>
For [Vundle][3] user, just add `Plugin 'Yggdroot/LeaderF'` to your `.vimrc`.

Performance
-----------

LeaderF is already very fast. If you want better performance, install the C extension of the fuzzy matching algorithm, which is more than 10 times faster.  
To install the C extension, follow the below:

 - On Linux/Unix/MacOS:

    First, make sure `python2` and/or `python3` commands are available.  
    Then run the installation script:

    ```sh
    cd ~/.vim/bundle/LeaderF
    ./install.sh
    ```
    Uninstall the C extension:

        ./install.sh --reverse

    If you are using [vim-plug][5]:

        Plug 'Yggdroot/LeaderF', { 'do': './install.sh' }

 - On Windows:

    First, make sure `py -2` and/or `py -3` commands are available.  
    Then run the installation script:

    ```sh
    cd ~\.vim\bundle\LeaderF
    .\install.bat
    ```
    There may be some error during the installation, please google the error messages to resolve it.  
    For example, `"error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"`, you can turn to [here][6] for help.

    Uninstall the C extension:

        .\install.bat --reverse

    If you are using [vim-plug][5]:

        Plug 'Yggdroot/LeaderF', { 'do': '.\install.bat' }

After running any command of LeaderF, check the value of `echo g:Lf_fuzzyMatch_C`, if the value is 1, it means the C extension is loaded sucessfully.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

specific arguments:
  -e <PATTERN>..., --regexp <PATTERN>...
                        A pattern to search for. This option can be provided multiple times, where all
                        patterns given are searched.
  -F, --fixed-strings   Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.
  -i, --ignore-case     Searches case insensitively.
  -L, --follow          Follow symbolic links while traversing directories.
  -P, --pcre2           When this flag is present, rg will use the PCRE2 regex engine instead of its
                        default regex engine.
  -S, --smart-case      Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase, case sensitively
                        otherwise.
  -s, --case-sensitive  Searches case sensitively.
  -v, --invert-match    Invert matching. Show lines that do not match the given patterns.
  -w, --word-regexp     Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries. This is roughly equivalent to
                        putting \b before and after all of the search patterns.
  -x, --line-regexp     Only show matches surrounded by line boundaries.
  --hidden              Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories
                        are skipped.
  --no-config           Never read configuration files. When this flag is present, rg will not respect
                        the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
  --no-ignore           Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.). This implies
                        --no-ignore-parent and --no-ignore-vcs.
  --no-ignore-global    Don't respect ignore files that come from 'global' sources such as git's
                        `core.excludesFile` configuration option (which defaults to
                        `$HOME/.config/git/ignore`).
  --no-ignore-parent    Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) in parent directories.
  --no-ignore-vcs       Don't respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.).
  -E <ENCODING>, --encoding <ENCODING>
                        Specify the text encoding that rg will use on all files searched.
  -M <NUM>, --max-columns <NUM>
                        Don't print lines longer than this limit in bytes.
  -m <NUM>, --max-count <NUM>
                        Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.
  --max-depth <NUM>     Limit the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond the paths given.
  --max-filesize <NUM+SUFFIX?>
                        Ignore files larger than NUM in size. This does not apply to directories.
  -g <GLOB>..., --glob <GLOB>...
                        Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given
                        glob.(This option can be provided multiple times.)
  --iglob <GLOB>...     Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob.
                        Globs are matched case insensitively.(This option can be provided multiple times.)
  --ignore-file <PATH>...
                        Specifies a path to one or more .gitignore format rules files.
  --type-add <TYPE_SPEC>...
                        Add a new glob for a particular file type.
  -t <TYPE>..., --type <TYPE>...
                        Only search files matching TYPE. Multiple type flags may be provided.
  -T <TYPE>..., --type-not <TYPE>...
                        Do not search files matching TYPE. Multiple type-not flags may be provided.
  <PATH>                A file or directory to search. Directories are searched recursively. Paths
                        specified on the command line override glob and ignore rules.
  --current-buffer      Searches in current buffer.
  --all-buffers         Searches in all listed buffers.
  --recall              Recall last search. If the result window is closed, reopen it.
  --append              Append to the previous search results.

  --fuzzy               LeaderF is in Fuzzy mode by default
  --regexMode           LeaderF is in Regex mode by default
  --nowrap              long lines in the LeaderF window won't wrap

If [!] is given, enter normal mode directly.
```

You can customize some handy maps, e.g.,

```vim
" search word under cursor, the pattern is treated as regex, and enter normal mode directly
noremap <C-F> :<C-U><C-R>=printf("Leaderf! rg -e %s ", expand("<cword>"))<CR>
" search word under cursor, the pattern is treated as regex,
" append the result to previous search results.
noremap <C-G> :<C-U><C-R>=printf("Leaderf! rg --append -e %s ", expand("<cword>"))<CR>
" search word under cursor literally only in current buffer
noremap <C-B> :<C-U><C-R>=printf("Leaderf! rg -F --current-buffer -e %s ", expand("<cword>"))<CR>
" search visually selected text literally, don't quit LeaderF after accepting an entry
xnoremap gf :<C-U><C-R>=printf("Leaderf! rg -F --stayOpen -e %s ", leaderf#Rg#visual())<CR>
" recall last search. If the result window is closed, reopen it.
noremap go :<C-U>Leaderf! rg --stayOpen --recall<CR>
```
Once LeaderF is launched:

Input formats:

 * In **NameOnly** mode (*fuzzy mode*)

    If the first character you input is `';'`, then the searching will be the same as in **FullPath** mode.<br>
    If you input string as `'abc;def'`, then `'abc'` will match the file name and `'def'` will match the directory name.

 * In **FullPath** mode (*fuzzy mode*)

    Same as in **NameOnly** mode except that the pattern will match the full path but not the file name only.

 * In **Regexp** mode

    The input string is the same as the Vim's regexp.

Smart Case:

 * If the characters in search pattern are all lowercase, the matching is case-insensitive. If the search pattern contains uppercase characters, all lowercase characters still are matched case-insensitively, the uppercase characters can only match upper case. So uppercase characters can speed up the narrowing down of the searching result.  

    e.g., input `abcDef`，it can match the following strings:
    ```
    abcDef
    AbcDef
    abcDEf
    aBcDeF
    ```
    but can not match the strings such as:
    ```
    abcdef
    Abcdef
    ```
    Note: `abc` and `ef` are still case-insensitive.

And operator:

 * In fuzzy mode, using `' '`(space) as the **and** operator, the candidate lines should fuzzily match all the substrings separated by space.

    e.g., input `abc def gh`，it can match the following strings:
    ```
    ...a.b.c...d.e.f...g.h...
    ...a.b.c...g.h...d.e.f...
    ...a.d..e.g.b.c...h..f...
    ...gh...def...abc...
    ```

Customization
-------------

 * Change key bindings

    By default, `<Up>` and `<Down>` are used to recall last/next input pattern from history. If you want to use them to navigate the result list just like `<C-K>` and `<C-J>` :

    `let g:Lf_CommandMap = {'<C-K>': ['<Up>'], '<C-J>': ['<Down>']}`

    for more detail, please refer to `:h g:Lf_CommandMap`.

 * Customize the statusline

    Please refer to [here][4].

 * Change the highlight of matched string

    ```vim
    highlight Lf_hl_match gui=bold guifg=Blue cterm=bold ctermfg=21
    highlight Lf_hl_matchRefine  gui=bold guifg=Magenta cterm=bold ctermfg=201
    ```

 * Change the default mapping of searching files command

    e.g. `let g:Lf_ShortcutF = '<C-P>'`
